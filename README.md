🚗 Ingridy Vehicles — Responsive Vehicle Sales Page

This project is a responsive web page created as part of my personal learning journey with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.
It presents a fictional dealership called “Ingridy Veículos – Currais Novos/RN”, showcasing used motorcycles and cars with an elegant layout, smooth structure, and user-friendly interface.

Navigation bar with dropdown menu and search functionality.

Cards section displaying vehicles with images, descriptions, and WhatsApp contact buttons.

Contact form centered and easy to access for user interaction.

Custom typography from Google Fonts for a stylish, personal look.

Clean layout and consistent spacing to improve readability and visual flow.

This project represents my effort to:

Practice and understand Bootstrap 5 components and utilities.

Experiment with responsive layouts that adapt across devices.

Apply modern web design principles (readability, spacing, color contrast, typography).
